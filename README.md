# Ruby on Rails Tutorial

## Toy App

This is the second application for the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](https://www.railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl](https://www.michaelhartl.com/).

## Description

From Chapter 2:
> "A toy demo application to show off some of the power of Rails. The purpose is to get a high-level overview of Ruby on Rails programming (and web development in general) by rapidly generating an application using _scaffold generators_, which create a large amount of functionality automatically. ... The resulting toy app will allow us to interact with it through its URLs, giving us insight into the structure of a Rails application, including a first example of the _REST architecture_ favored by Rails."

## Deployment

App deployed on [Heroku](https://pacific-plateau-63523.herokuapp.com/)
